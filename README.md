# CPSC 210 Term Project

## Music Playlist Creator

For my term project I will create a music playlist creator intended for users
to create and save a playlist. Users will be able to add songs to a playlist
and retrieve information about individual songs and rank them on scale out of five.
The music playlist creator will save users song rankings for future
reference to help users track which songs they like and dislike. The music playlist
creator is intended for anyone who enjoys music and who may want to keep
track of their favourite songs. I chose to create this 
Music Playlist Creator because I am constantly listening to music and I would love a way
to sort and rank the songs im listening too!
