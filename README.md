# CPSC 210 Term Project

## School Calendar

 For my term project I want to create an application to 
track assignments and to set reminders. I want my
application to be able to categorize assignments by their corresponding
subjects and to be able to sort them by their due dates/times. I would also like my application to set
reminders for projects due within a week, and to be able to
remove assignments and reminders in which their due dates have already passed. My application should also 
be  able to mark assignments as completed and to be able to track reoccurring assignments.
 Overall my application is intended
for students as it will be helpful for them to keep track of assignments and schedules.
 And so, this is of interest to me as I am a student, and I'm hoping that I will be able to use this application
 myself.
